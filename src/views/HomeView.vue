         This is very much a growing guide to Vue.js - 
         and will reflect my own learning and growth as I progress. <br> 
         It may never be a complete guide, but it may be useful in that it
         expresses an opinionated approach which may match your own. For example,
         I won't necessarily cover all the options which other guides may be
         obliged to do for backwards-compatibility concerns.      
      </p>
      <p>
         For a comprehensive guide, I recommend the
