# intro

This is very much a growing guide to Vue.js - and will reflect my own learning and growth as I progress.
It may never be a complete guide, but it may be useful in that it expresses an opinionated approach which
may match you own. For example, I won't necessarily cover all the options which other guides may be obliged 
to do for backwards-compatibility concerns.

For a comprehensive guide, I recommend the [Vue.js Guide](https://vuejs.org/guide/introduction.html)
